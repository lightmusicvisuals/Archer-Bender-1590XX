# Archer-Bender-1590XX
Expansion of the Archer Experimenter with layout accommodating 4 blocks of controls. This board fits nicely in a Hammond 1590XX enclosure. There is no drill template so use the board to make one before you build it.

All pots 9mm Alpha or equivalent. "ON" and "DEST" toggle switches are SPDT ON-ON variety. "MOD" toggle switch should be SPDT ON-OFF-ON but ON-ON will also work.

ENHANCE potentiometer value to taste...1k and 10k work well. Choose value for ?K resistor after installation. I have built units with 10K ENHANCE pot and 10K resistor as well as 1K ENHANCE pot and 10R resistor.

Choose "LEV" potentiometer values to taste. I generally use 1K but you may want to use a larger value to eliminate effect on more intense bends.

Choose bend paths with "S" and "D" pads. The two "D" pads are connected to the "DEST" toggle switches. Two bend paths per control block.

The "P" pads are optional and can be used to bypass the "ON" switches with a push button switch.

The "MOD" switch toggles between components populated in the "MOD" pads. The center "MOD" pad will be active regardless of toggle position. The pads above "MOD" area can be used to accommodate larger format capacitors or inductors.

VCC between 9vdc and 12vdc have been tested. WARNING: Q3C bend point is continuous with VCC. I haven't blown anything up yet but use this in your bends at your own risk. 

Please don't sell these PCBs or assembled units.
